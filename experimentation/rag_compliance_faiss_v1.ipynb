Our regulations at §\\u2009418.306(c) require each labor market to be established using the most current hospital wage data available, including any changes made by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) definitions.\\nIn general, OMB issues major revisions to statistical areas every 10 years, based on the results of the decennial census. However, OMB occasionally issues minor updates and revisions to statistical areas in the years between the decennial censuses. On September 14, 2018, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 18-04, which superseded the April 10, 2018, OMB Bulletin No. 18-03. OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 made revisions to the delineations of MSAs, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas (CSA), and guidance on uses of the delineations in these areas. This bulletin provided the delineations of all MSAs, Metropolitan Divisions, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, CSAs, and New England City and Town Areas in the United States and Puerto Rico based on the standards published on June 28, 2010, in the Federal Register (75 FR 37246 through 37252), and Census Bureau data. A copy of the September 14, 2018, bulletin is available online at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bulletin-18-04.pdf. In the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47080), we finalized our proposal to adopt the revised OMB delineations from the September 14, 2018, OMB Bulletin 18-04 with a 5-percent cap on wage index decreases, where the estimated reduction in a geographic area's wage index would be capped at 5-percent in FY 2021 and no cap would be applied to wage index decreases for the second year (FY 2022). On March 6, 2020, OMB issued Bulletin No. 20-01, which provided updates to and superseded OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 that was issued on September 14, 2018. The attachments to OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 provided detailed information on the update to statistical areas since September 14, 2018, and were based on the application of the 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas to Census Bureau population estimates for July 1, 2017, and July 1, 2018. (For a copy of this bulletin, we refer readers to the following website: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf). In OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, OMB announced one new Micropolitan Statistical Area, one new component of an existing CSA, and changes to New England City and Town Area (NECTA) delineations. In the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070), we stated that if appropriate, we would propose any updates from OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 in future rulemaking. After reviewing OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, we determined that the changes in Bulletin 20-01 encompassed delineation changes that would not affect the Medicare wage index for FY 2022. Specifically, the updates consisted of changes to NECTA delineations and the redesignation of a single rural county into a newly created Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Medicare wage index does not utilize NECTA definitions, and, as most recently discussed in the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070), we include hospitals located in Micropolitan Statistical Areas in each State's rural wage index. \\nAs described in the August 8, 1997, Hospice Wage Index final rule (62 FR 42860), the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index is used as the raw wage index for the hospice benefit. These raw wage index values are subject to application of the hospice floor to compute the hospice wage index used to determine payments to hospices. As previously discussed, the pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8000 will be further adjusted by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8000. For example, if County A has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.3994, we would multiply 0.3994 by 1.15, which equals 0.4593. Since 0.4593 is not greater than 0.8000, then County A's hospice wage index would be 0.4593. In another example, if County B has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.7440, we would multiply 0.7440 by 1.15, which equals 0.8556. Because 0.8556 is greater than 0.8000, County B's hospice wage index would be 0.8000. \\nIn the FY 2023 Hospice Wage Index final rule (87 FR 45673), we finalized for FY 2023 and subsequent years, the application of a permanent 5-percent cap on any decrease to a geographic area's wage index from its wage index in the prior year, regardless of the circumstances causing the decline, so that a geographic area's wage index would not be less than 95 percent of its wage index calculated in the prior FY. When calculating the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases we start with the current fiscal year's pre-floor, pre-reclassification hospital wage index value for a core-based statistical area (CBSA) or statewide rural area and if that wage index value is below 0.8000, we apply the hospice floor as discussed here. Next, we compare the current fiscal year's wage index value after the application of the hospice floor to the final wage index value from the previous fiscal year. If the current fiscal year's wage index value is less than 95 percent of the previous year's wage index value, the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases would be applied and the final wage index value would be set equal to 95 percent of the previous fiscal year's wage index value. If the 5-percent cap is applied in one fiscal year, then in the subsequent fiscal year, that year's pre-floor, pre-reclassification hospital wage index would be used as the starting wage index value and adjusted by the hospice floor. The hospice floor adjusted wage index value would be compared to the previous fiscal year's wage index which had the 5-percent cap applied. If the hospice floor adjusted wage index value for that fiscal year is less than 95 percent of the capped wage index from the previous year, then the 5-percent cap would be applied again, and the final wage index value would be 95 percent of the capped wage index from the previous fiscal year. Using the example previously stated, if County A has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.3994, we would multiply 0.3994 by 1.15, which equals 0.4593. If County A had a wage index value of 0.6200 in the previous fiscal year, then we would compare 0.4593 to the previous fiscal year's wage index value. Since 0.4593 is less than 95 percent of 0.6200, then County A's hospice wage index would be 0.5890, which is equal to 95-percent of the previous fiscal year's wage index value of 0.6200. In the next fiscal year, the updated wage index value would be compared to the wage index value of 0.5890.\\nPreviously, this methodology was applied to all the counties that make up the CBSA or rural area. However, as discussed in section III.A.2.f of this final rule, because we are adopting the revised OMB delineations this methodology will also be applied to individual counties.\\nIn the FY 2020 Hospice Wage Index final rule (84 FR 38484), we finalized the proposal to use the current FY's hospital wage index data to calculate the hospice wage index values. For FY 2025, we proposed that the hospice wage index would be based on the FY 2025 hospital pre-floor, pre-reclassified wage index for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020 and before October 1, 2021 (FY 2021 cost report data). We also stated that the proposed FY 2025 hospice wage index would not consider any geographic reclassification of hospitals, including those in accordance with section 1886(d)(8)(B) or 1886(d)(10) of the Act. The regulations that govern hospice payment do not provide a mechanism for allowing hospices to seek geographic reclassification or to utilize the rural floor provisions that exist for Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals. The reclassification provision found in section 1886(d)(10) of the Act is specific to hospitals. Section 4410(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) provides that the area wage index applicable to any hospital that is located in an urban area of a State may not be less than the area wage index applicable to hospitals located in rural areas in that State. This rural floor provision is also specific to hospitals. Because the reclassification and the hospital rural floor policies apply to hospitals only, and not to hospices, we continue to believe the use of the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index results is the most appropriate adjustment to the labor portion of the hospice payment rates. This position is longstanding and consistent with other Medicare payment systems, for example, the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system (SNF PPS), the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (IRF PPS), and the home health prospective payment system (HH PPS). However, the hospice wage index does include the hospice floor, which is applicable to all CBSAs, both rural and urban. The hospice floor adjusts pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8000 by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8000. We proposed that the FY 2025 hospice wage index would also include the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases. The appropriate wage index value would be applied to the labor portion of the hospice payment rate based on the geographic area in which the beneficiary resides when receiving RHC or CHC. The appropriate wage index value is applied to the labor portion of the payment rate based on the geographic location of the facility for beneficiaries receiving GIP or IRC.\\nWe received 28 comments on the proposed FY 2025 hospice wage index from various stakeholders including hospices, national industry associations, and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). A summary of these comments and our responses appear below:\\nComment: One commenter expressed concern with the wage index assigned to Montgomery County, Maryland (MD). This commenter stated that Montgomery County, MD has a similar cost of living compared to Washington, DC and shares the same labor market when competing for labor; therefore, hospices in Montgomery County should be reimbursed at the same level as hospices in Washington, DC This commenter stated that hospices in Montgomery County are at a long-term competitive disadvantage due to a Medicare hospice federal payment inequity involving CBSAs and recommended that CMS assign the hospice wage index valuation for the Washington, DC CBSA to the Montgomery/Frederick County CBSA for a time-limited period, such as 5 years, in order to evaluate the impact on Montgomery County hospices. \\nResponse: We thank the commenter for the recommendation. However, we continue to believe that the OMB's geographic area delineations represent a useful proxy for differentiating between labor markets and that the geographic area delineations are appropriate for use in determining Medicare hospice payments. The general concept of the CBSAs is that of an area containing a recognized population nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus. The purpose of the 2020 standards for delineating Core Based Statistical Areas is to provide nationally consistent definitions for collecting, tabulating, and publishing federal statistics for a set of geographic areas. CBSAs include adjacent counties that have a minimum of 25 percent commuting to the central counties of the area. Based on the OMB's current delineations, Montgomery County belongs in a separate CBSA from the areas defined in the Washington, DC CBSA (CBSA 47764). Unlike IPPS hospitals, IRFs, and SNFs, where each provider uses a single wage index value, hospice agencies may serve multiple CBSAs and be reimbursed based on more than one wage index value. Payments are based upon the location of the beneficiary for routine and continuous home care or the location of the facility for respite and general inpatient care. Hospices in Montgomery County, Maryland may provide RHC and CHC to patients in the Washington, DC CBSA, as well as to patients in other surrounding CBSAs. We have used CBSAs for determining hospice payments since FY 2006 and continue to believe that using the most current OMB delineations provides an accurate representation of geographic variation in wage levels and do not believe it would be appropriate to allow hospices to opt for, or be assigned, a CBSA designation with a higher wage index value. However, if a future OMB Bulletin updates the designation for Montgomery County, Maryland, we would propose this change through our normal rulemaking process. \\nComment: A few commenters opposed the use of the IPPS wage index as the basis for the hospice wage index. In general, these commenters stated that the use of hospital wage data is inappropriate and recommended that CMS utilize more appropriate wage information for the hospice wage index. These commenters expressed concern that the hospital wage index is derived from cost report wage data submitted by hospitals which explicitly excludes hospice wage costs. Commenters suggested that the exclusion of hospice costs undermines the accuracy of wage adjustments for hospice providers and has the potential to lead to inadequate services for terminally ill beneficiaries. Additionally, two commenters also expressed concern with the lag in the hospital cost report data used as the basis for the hospice wage index. One commenter stated that the lag in the wage index data used in the proposed rule likely means that any increase in reimbursement rates will be quickly, and possibly completely, subsumed by recent and anticipated inflation rates. \\nResponse: We appreciate the commenters concerns; however, these comments are outside the scope of the proposed rule, as we did not propose changes to our hospice wage index methodology. Changes to the hospice wage index methodology, including changes to the underlying data used to create the hospice wage index, would have to go through notice and comment rulemaking. Furthermore, we continue to believe the use of the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index results is the most appropriate adjustment to the labor portion of the hospice payment rates. This position is longstanding and consistent with other Medicare payment systems; however, we will consider these comments in the future if CMS does consider changes to this methodology. \\nComment: A few commenters recommended more far-reaching revisions to the hospice wage index methodology. Some commenters, including MedPAC, recommended an overhaul of the entire hospice wage index methodology. One commenter stated that the time is long overdue for CMS to develop and implement a wage index model that is consistent across all provider types so that all providers have a level playing field from which to compete for personnel. MedPAC recommended that existing Medicare wage index policies be repealed, including current exceptions, and to phase in a new Medicare wage index system for hospitals and other types of providers that uses all-employer, occupation-level wage data with different occupation weights for the wage index of each provider type; reflects local area level differences in wages between and within metropolitan statistical areas and statewide rural areas; and smooths wage index differences across adjacent local areas. In addition, many commenters recommended allowing hospices to take advantage of wage index protections afforded to hospitals such as geographic redesignation and the rural floor. One commenter suggested that CMS investigate how MedPAC's wage index proposal would impact hospices and work with stakeholders, including Congress, to determine how to implement a fairer system that also takes into account increased labor costs. \\nResponse: We appreciate the commenters' recommendations; however, these comments are outside the scope of the proposed rule, as we did not propose changes to our hospice wage index methodology. Any changes regarding the adjustment of the hospice payments to account for geographic wage differences, beyond the wage index proposals discussed in the FY 2025 Hospice Wage Index and Rate Update proposed rule, would require notice and comment rulemaking. \\nComment: Several commenters also expressed concern that hospices are not given the opportunity for geographic reclassification like hospitals. These commenters recommended that hospices be allowed to reclassify to a different CBSA to receive a higher wage index in order to compete with hospitals and other health systems for the same labor pool. One commenter stated that the inability to reclassify a hospice's wage index means the hospice wage index often fails to reflect true labor costs accurately, placing the hospice at a competitive and financial disadvantage. Another commenter recommended that reclassification be allowed for provider-based home health and hospice providers who are a part of a hospital and/or health system. Many commenters also recommended that CMS reinstitute the rural floor policy so that no hospice serving patients in urban areas is paid below the rural wage index value of the State. These commenters stated that hospices are at a competitive disadvantage because they are unable to take advantage of geographic reclassification and the rural floor provisions that are allowed for hospitals. \\nResponse: We remind stakeholders that the statutory provisions that govern hospice payment do not provide a mechanism for allowing hospices to seek geographic reclassification or to utilize the rural floor provisions that exist for IPPS hospitals. The reclassification provision found in section 1886(d)(10) of the Act is specific to hospitals. Section 4410(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) provides that the area wage index applicable to any hospital that is in an urban area of a State may not be less than the area wage index applicable to hospitals located in rural areas in that State. This rural floor provision is also specific to hospitals. Because the reclassification provision and the hospital rural floor apply only to hospitals, and not to hospices (even those hospices that are affiliated with a hospital or other health care system), we continue to believe the use of the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index results is the most appropriate adjustment to the labor portion of the hospice payment rates. However, we note that hospices do receive the hospice floor which adjusts the pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8000 by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8000 and the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases. \\nComment: Two commenters encouraged CMS to add details and transparency to the wage index section of the rule. These commenters requested that CMS describe in detail how the wage index is calculated, the basis in the hospital cost report, and the role of the wage index standardization factor. Commenters requested this information so that hospices receive more information on how and why year to year wage index variation occurs. \\nResponse: We thank the commenters for their recommendations. In reference to the commenters' recommendation for more details describing how the pre- floor pre-reclassified wage index is calculated, we refer readers to the FY 2025 IPPS proposed rule (89 FR 36139 through 36159) for additional information on the cost report worksheets used to calculate the wage index, information on how those worksheets are validated, the process for hospitals to request corrections, and the method for calculating the proposed unadjusted wage index. Once we receive the pre-floor, pre-reclassified wage index values as discussed, those values are then adjusted by the hospice floor so that all wage index values lower than 0.8000 are increased by 15 percent up to 0.8000. The hospice floor adjusted wage index values are subsequently updated by the permanent 5-percent cap on wage index decreases so that the wage index for the current fiscal year is not less than 95 percent of the wage index value the previous fiscal year. Regarding the wage index standardization factors, we finalized in the FY 2017 Hospice Wage Index and Rate Update final rule (81 FR 52156), a policy of applying wage index standardization factors for each level of care to hospice payments in order to eliminate the aggregate effect of annual variations in hospital wage data. In order to calculate the wage index standardization factor, we simulate total payments using FY 2023 hospice utilization claims data with the FY 2024 wage index (pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index with the hospice floor, old OMB delineations, and the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases) and FY 2024 payment rates and compare that total to our simulation of total payments using FY 2023 utilization claims data, the final FY 2025 hospice wage index (pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index with hospice floor, and the revised OMB delineations, with the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases) and FY 2024 payment rates. By dividing payments for each level of care (RHC days 1 through 60, RHC days 61+, CHC, IRC, and GIP) using the FY 2024 wage index and FY 2024 payment rates for each level of care by the FY 2025 wage index and FY 2024 payment rates, we obtain a wage index standardization factor for each level of care. The wage index standardization factors for each level of care are then applied to the national payment amounts for that level of care to calculate the final FY 2025 payment amounts. \\nFinal Decision: We are finalizing our proposal to use the FY 2025 pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index data as the basis for the FY 2025 hospice wage index. The wage index applicable for FY 2025 is available on our website at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice/Hospice-Wage-Index. The hospice wage index for FY 2025 is effective October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025. \\nThere exist some geographic areas where there are no hospitals, and thus, no hospital wage data on which to base the calculation of the hospice wage index. In the FY 2006 Hospice Wage Index final rule (70 FR 45135), we adopted the policy that, for urban labor markets without a hospital from which hospital wage index data could be derived, all the CBSAs within the State would be used to calculate a statewide urban average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value to use as a reasonable proxy for these areas. For FY 2025, the only CBSA without a hospital from which hospital wage data can be derived is 25980, Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia. The FY 2025 final wage index value for Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia is 0.8872.\\nIn the FY 2008 Hospice Wage Index final rule (72 FR 50217 through 50218), we implemented a methodology to update the hospice wage index for rural areas without hospital wage data. In cases where there was a rural area without rural hospital wage data, we use the average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index data from all contiguous CBSAs, to represent a reasonable proxy for the rural area. The term “contiguous” means sharing a border (72 FR 50217). For FY 2025, as part of our proposal to adopt the revised OMB delineations discussed further in section III.A.2 of this final rule, we proposed that rural North Dakota would now become a rural area without a hospital from which hospital wage data can be derived. Therefore, to calculate the wage index for rural area 99935, North Dakota, we proposed to use as a proxy, the average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage data (updated by the hospice floor) from the contiguous CBSAs: CBSA 13900-Bismark, ND, CBSA 22020-Fargo, ND-MN, CBSA 24220-Grand Forks, ND-MN and CBSA 33500, Minot, ND, which resulted in a proposed FY 2025 hospice wage index of 0.8446 for rural North Dakota.\\nWhile no commenters expressly opposed or supported this proposal, we did receive one comment acknowledging the proposal to shift rural North Dakota to a rural area without a hospital from which hospital data can be formulated. We are finalizing our proposal to use as a proxy the average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage data (updated by the hospice floor) from the contiguous CBSAs: CBSA 13900-Bismark, ND, CBSA 22020-Fargo, ND-MN, CBSA 24220-Grand Forks, ND-MN and CBSA 33500, Minot, ND. For this final rule, using updated data, the final FY 2025 hospice wage index for rural North Dakota is 0.8545. \\nPreviously, the only rural area without a hospital from which hospital wage data could be derived was in Puerto Rico. However, for rural Puerto Rico, we did not apply this methodology due to the distinct economic circumstances that exist there (for example, due to the close proximity of almost all of Puerto Rico's various urban areas to non-urban areas, this methodology would produce a wage index for rural Puerto Rico that is higher than that in half of its urban areas); instead, we used the most recent wage index previously available for that area which was 0.4047, subsequently adjusted by the hospice floor for an adjusted wage index value of 0.4654. For FY 2025, we noted that as part of our proposal to adopt the revised OMB delineations discussed further in section III.A.2.c of this final rule, there would now be a hospital in rural Puerto Rico from which hospital wage data can be derived. Therefore, we proposed that the wage index for rural Puerto Rico would now be based on the hospital wage data for the area instead of the previously available pre-hospice floor wage index of 0.4047, which equaled an adjusted wage index value of 0.4654. The FY 2025 proposed pre-hospice floor unadjusted wage index for rural Puerto Rico would be 0.2520, and is subsequently adjusted by the hospice floor to equal 0.2898. Because 0.2898 is more than a 5-percent decline in the FY 2024 wage index, the adjusted FY 2025 wage index with the 5-percent cap applied would equal 0.95 multiplied by 0.4654 (that is, the FY 2024 wage index with floor), which resulted in a proposed wage index of 0.4421.\\nWe did not receive any comments on our proposal to use hospital wage data to calculate the wage index of rural Puerto Rico instead of the previously available hospice floor adjusted wage index of 0.4654. We are finalizing this policy as proposed. For FY 2025 the final hospice wage index for rural Puerto Rico is 0.2510, subsequently adjusted by the hospice floor which equals 0.2887. Because 0.2887 is more than a 5-percent decline in the FY 2024 wage index, the adjusted FY 2025 wage index with the 5-percent cap applied will equal 0.95 multiplied by 0.4654 (that is, the FY 2024 wage index with floor), which results in a final wage index of 0.4421.\\nFinally, due to the proposed adoption of the revised OMB delineations discussed in section III.A.2.c of this final rule, we noted that Delaware, which was previously an all-urban State, would now have one rural area with a hospital from which hospital wage data can be derived. As such, the proposed FY 2025 wage index for rural area 99908 Delaware was 1.0429. We did not receive any comments on our proposal to use hospital wage data to calculate the wage index of rural Delaware. We are finalizing our proposal and the FY 2025 final hospice wage index for rural Delaware is 1.0385.\"}\n",

Our regulations at §\\u2009418.306(c) require each labor market to be established using the most current hospital wage data available, including any changes made by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) definitions.\\nIn general, OMB issues major revisions to statistical areas every 10 years, based on the results of the decennial census. However, OMB occasionally issues minor updates and revisions to statistical areas in the years between the decennial censuses. On September 14, 2018, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 18-04, which superseded the April 10, 2018 OMB Bulletin No. 18-03. OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 made revisions to the delineations of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and guidance on uses of the delineations in these areas. This bulletin provided the delineations of all MSAs, Metropolitan Divisions, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas, and New England City and Town Areas in the United States and Puerto Rico based on the standards published on June 28, 2010, in the Federal Register (75 FR 37246 through 37252), and Census Bureau data. A copy of the September 14, 2018 bulletin is available online at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bulletin-18-04.pdf. In the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47080), we finalized our proposal to adopt the revised OMB delineations from the September 14, 2018 OMB Bulletin 18-04 with a 5-percent cap on wage index decreases, where the estimated reduction in a geographic area's wage index would be capped at 5-percent in FY 2021 and no cap would be applied to wage index decreases for the second year (FY 2022). On March 6, 2020, OMB issued Bulletin No. 20-01, which provided updates to and superseded OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 that was issued on September 14, 2018. The attachments to OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 provided detailed information on the update to statistical areas since September 14, 2018, and were based on the application of the 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas to Census Bureau population estimates for July 1, 2017 and July 1, 2018. (For a copy of this bulletin, we refer readers to the following website: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf.) In OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, OMB announced one new Micropolitan Statistical Area, one new component of an existing Combined Statistical Area (CSA), and changes to New England City and Town Area (NECTA) delineations. In the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070) we stated that if appropriate, we would propose any updates from OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 in future rulemaking. After reviewing OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, we determined that the changes in Bulletin 20-01 encompassed delineation changes that would not affect the Medicare wage index for FY 2022. Specifically, the updates consisted of changes to NECTA delineations and the redesignation of a single rural county into a newly created Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Medicare wage index does not utilize NECTA definitions, and, as most recently discussed in the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070), we include hospitals located in Micropolitan Statistical areas in each State's rural wage index. \\nAs described in the August 8, 1997 Hospice Wage Index final rule (62 FR 42860), the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index is used as the raw wage index for the hospice benefit. These raw wage index values are subject to application of the hospice floor to compute the hospice wage index used to determine payments to hospices. As previously discussed, the pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8 will be further adjusted by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8. For example, if County A has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.3994, we would multiply 0.3994 by 1.15, which equals 0.4593. Since 0.4593 is not greater than 0.8, then County A's hospice wage index would be 0.4593. In another example, if County B has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.7440, we would multiply 0.7440 by 1.15, which equals 0.8556. Because 0.8556 is greater than 0.8, County B's hospice wage index would be 0.8.\\nIn the FY 2023 Hospice Wage Index final rule (87 FR 45673), we finalized for FY 2023 and subsequent years, the application of a permanent 5-percent cap on any decrease to a geographic area's wage index from its wage index in the prior year, regardless of the circumstances causing the decline, so that a geographic area's wage index would not be less than 95 percent of its wage index calculated in the prior FY. When calculating the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases we start with the current fiscal year's pre-floor, pre-reclassification hospital wage index value for a core-based statistical area (CBSA) or statewide rural area and if that wage index value is below 0.8000, we apply the hospice floor as discussed above. Next, we compare the current fiscal year's wage index value after the application of the hospice floor to the final wage index value from the previous fiscal year. If the current fiscal year's wage index value is less than 95 percent of the previous year's wage index value, the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases would be applied and the final wage index value would be set equal to 95 percent of the previous fiscal year's wage index value. If the 5-percent cap is applied in one fiscal year, then in the subsequent fiscal year, that year's pre-floor, pre-reclassification hospital wage index would be used as the starting wage index value and adjusted by the hospice floor. The hospice floor adjusted wage index value would be compared to the previous fiscal year's wage index which had the 5-percent cap applied. If the hospice floor adjusted wage index value for that fiscal year is less than 95 percent of the capped wage index from the previous year, then the 5-percent cap would be applied again, and the final wage index value would be 95 percent of the capped wage index from the previous fiscal year. Using the example from above, if County A has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.3994, we would multiply 0.3994 by 1.15, which equals 0.4593. If County A had a wage index value of 0.6200 in the previous fiscal, then we would compare 0.4593 to the previous fiscal year's wage index value. Since 0.4593 is less than 95 percent of 0.6200, then County A's hospice wage index would be 0.5890, which is equal to 95-percent of the previous fiscal year's wage index value of 0.6200. In the next fiscal year, the updated wage index value would be compared to the wage index value of 0.5890.\\nPreviously, this methodology was applied to all the counties that make up the CBSA or rural area. However, as discussed in section III.A.2.f., if we adopt the revised OMB delineations this methodology would also be applied to individual counties.\\nIn the FY 2020 Hospice Wage Index final rule (84 FR 38484), we finalized the proposal to use the current FY's hospital wage index data to calculate the hospice wage index values. For FY 2025, we are proposing that the proposed hospice wage index would be based on the FY 2025 hospital pre-floor, pre-reclassified wage index for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2020 and before October 1, 2021 (FY 2021 cost report data). The proposed FY 2025 hospice wage index would not take into account any geographic reclassification of hospitals, including those in accordance with section 1886(d)(8)(B) or 1886(d)(10) of the Act. The regulations that govern hospice payment do not provide a mechanism for allowing hospices to seek geographic reclassification or to utilize the rural floor provisions that exist for IPPS hospitals. The reclassification provision found in section 1886(d)(10) of the Act is specific to hospitals. Section 4410(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) provides that the area wage index applicable to any hospital that is located in an urban area of a State may not be less than the area wage index applicable to hospitals located in rural areas in that State. This rural floor provision is also specific to hospitals. Because the reclassification and the hospital rural floor policies apply to hospitals only, and not to hospices, we continue to believe the use of the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index results is the most appropriate adjustment to the labor portion of the hospice payment rates. This position is longstanding and consistent with other Medicare payment systems, for example, skilled nursing facility prospective payment system (SNF PPS), inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (IRF PPS), and home health prospective payment system (HH PPS). However, the hospice wage index does include the hospice floor, which is applicable to all CBSAs, both rural and urban. The hospice floor adjusts pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8 by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8. The proposed FY 2025 hospice wage index would also include the 5-percent cap on wage index decreases. The appropriate wage index value would be applied to the labor portion of the hospice payment rate based on the geographic area in which the beneficiary resides when receiving RHC or CHC. The appropriate wage index value is applied to the labor portion of the payment rate based on the geographic location of the facility for beneficiaries receiving GIP or IRC.\\nThere exist some geographic areas where there are no hospitals, and thus, no hospital wage data on which to base the calculation of the hospice wage index. In the FY 2006 Hospice Wage Index final rule (70 FR 45135), we adopted the policy that, for urban labor markets without a hospital from which hospital wage index data could be derived, all of the CBSAs within the State would be used to calculate a statewide urban average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value to use as a reasonable proxy for these areas. For FY 2025, the only CBSA without a hospital from which hospital wage data can be derived is 25980, Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia. The FY 2025 proposed wage index value for Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia is 0.8726. \\nIn the FY 2008 Hospice Wage Index final rule (72 FR 50217 through 50218), we implemented a methodology to update the hospice wage index for rural areas without hospital wage data. In cases where there was a rural area without rural hospital wage data, we use the average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index data from all contiguous CBSAs, to represent a reasonable proxy for the rural area. The term “contiguous” means sharing a border (72 FR 50217). For FY 2025, as part of our proposal to adopt the revised OMB delineations discussed further in section III.A.2, we are proposing that rural North Dakota would now become a rural area without a hospital from which hospital wage data can be devised. Therefore, to calculate the wage index for rural area 99935, North Dakota, we are proposing to use as a proxy, the average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage data (updated by the hospice floor) from the contiguous CBSAs: CBSA 13900-Bismark, ND, CBSA 22020-Fargo, ND-MN, CBSA 24220-Grand Forks, ND-MN and CBSA 33500, Minot, ND, which results in a proposed FY 2025 hospice wage index of 0.8446 for rural North Dakota.\\nPreviously, the only rural area without a hospital from which hospital wage data could be derived was in Puerto Rico. However, for rural Puerto Rico, we did not apply this methodology due to the distinct economic circumstances that exist there (for example, due to the close proximity of almost all of Puerto Rico's various urban areas to non-urban areas, this methodology would produce a wage index for rural Puerto Rico that is higher than that in half of its urban areas); instead, we used the most recent wage index previously available for that area which was 0.4047, subsequently adjusted by the hospice floor for an adjusted wage index value of 0.4654. For FY 2025, as part of our proposal to adopt the revised OMB delineations discussed further in section III.A.2.c. below, there would now be a hospital in rural Puerto Rico from which hospital wage data can be derived. Therefore, we are proposing that the wage index for rural Puerto Rico would now be based on the hospital wage data for the area instead of the previously available pre-hospice floor wage index of 0.4047, which equaled an adjusted wage index value of 0.4654. The FY 2025 proposed pre-hospice floor unadjusted wage index for rural Puerto Rico would be 0.2520, and is subsequently adjusted by the hospice floor to equal 0.2898. Because 0.2898 is more than a 5-percent decline in the FY 2024 wage index, the adjusted FY 2025 wage index with the 5-percent cap applied would equal 0.95 multiplied by 0.4654 (that is, the FY 2024 wage index with floor), which results in a proposed wage index of 0.4421.\\nFinally, we are proposing that for FY 2025, if the adoption of the revised OMB delineations is finalized that Delaware, which was previously an all-urban State, would now have one rural area with a hospital from which hospital wage data can be derived. The proposed FY 2025 wage index for rural area 99908 Delaware would be 1.0429.\"}\n",

The hospice wage index utilizes the wage adjustment factors used by the Secretary for purposes of section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act for hospital wage adjustments. Our regulations at §\\u2009418.306(c) require each labor market to be established using the most current hospital wage data available, including any changes made by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) definitions.\\nIn general, OMB issues major revisions to statistical areas every 10 years, based on the results of the decennial census. However, OMB occasionally issues minor updates and revisions to statistical areas in the years between the decennial censuses. On March 6, 2020, OMB issued Bulletin No. 20-01, which provided updates to and superseded OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 that was issued on September 14, 2018. The attachments to OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 provided detailed information on the update to statistical areas since September 14, 2018, and were based on the application of the 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas to Census Bureau population estimates for July 1, 2017, and July 1, 2018. For a copy of this bulletin, we refer readers to the following website: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf. In OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, OMB announced one new Micropolitan Statistical Area, one new component of an existing Combined Statistical Area (CSA), and changes to New England City and Town Area (NECTA) delineations. In the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070), we stated that if appropriate, we would propose any updates from OMB Bulletin No. 20-01 in future rulemaking. After reviewing OMB Bulletin No. 20-01, we determined that the changes in Bulletin 20-01 encompassed delineation changes that would not affect the Medicare wage index for FY 2022. Specifically, the updates consisted of changes to NECTA delineations and the redesignation of a single rural county into a newly created Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Medicare wage index does not utilize NECTA definitions, and, as most recently discussed in the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070), we include hospitals located in Micropolitan Statistical areas in each state's rural wage index. \\nIn the FY 2020 Hospice Wage Index final rule (84 FR 38484), we finalized the proposal to use the current FY's hospital wage index data to calculate the hospice wage index values. In the FY 2021 Hospice Wage Index final rule (85 FR 47070), we adopted the revised OMB delineations with a 5-percent cap on wage index decreases, where the estimated reduction in a geographic area's wage index would be capped at 5 percent in FY 2021 and no cap would be applied to wage index decreases for the second year (FY 2022). In the FY 2023 Hospice Wage Index final rule (87 FR 45673), we finalized for FY 2023 and subsequent years, the application of a permanent 5-percent cap on any decrease to a geographic area's wage index from its wage index in the prior year, regardless of the circumstances causing the decline, so that a geographic area's wage index would not be less than 95 percent of its wage index calculated in the prior FY.\\nFor FY 2024, the final hospice wage index is based on the FY 2024 hospital pre-floor, pre-reclassified wage index for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019 and before October 1, 2020 (FY 2020 cost report data). The final FY 2024 hospice wage index does not take into account any geographic reclassification of hospitals, including those in accordance with section 1886(d)(8)(B) or 1886(d)(10) of the Act. The final FY 2024 hospice wage index includes a 5-percent cap on wage index decreases. The appropriate wage index value would be applied to the labor portion of the hospice payment rate based on the geographic area in which the beneficiary resides when receiving RHC or CHC. The appropriate wage index value is applied to the labor portion of the payment rate based on the geographic location of the facility for beneficiaries receiving GIP or IRC.\\nIn the FY 2006 Hospice Wage Index final rule (70 FR 45135), we adopted the policy that, for urban labor markets without a hospital from which hospital wage index data could be derived, all the core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) within the state would be used to calculate a statewide urban average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value to use as a reasonable proxy for these areas. For FY 2024, the only CBSA without a hospital from which hospital wage data can be derived is 25980, Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia and the wage index value for Hinesville-Fort Stewart, Georgia is 0.8732. \\nTo address rural areas where there were no hospitals, and thus no hospital wage data on which to base the calculation of the hospice wage index, in the FY 2008 Hospice Wage Index final rule (72 FR 50217 through 50218), we implemented a methodology to update the hospice wage index for rural areas without hospital wage data. In cases where there was a rural area without rural hospital wage data, we would use the average pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index data from all contiguous CBSAs, to represent a reasonable proxy for the rural area. The term “contiguous” means sharing a border (72 FR 50217). Currently, the only rural area without a hospital from which hospital wage data could be derived is Puerto Rico. However, for rural Puerto Rico, we would not apply this methodology due to the distinct economic circumstances that exist there (for example, due to the close proximity of almost all of Puerto Rico's various urban areas to non-urban areas, this methodology would produce a wage index for rural Puerto Rico that is higher than that in half of its urban areas); instead, we would continue to use the most recent wage index previously available for that area. For FY 2024, we proposed to continue using the most recent pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value available for Puerto Rico, which is 0.4047, subsequently adjusted by the hospice floor.\\nAs described in the August 8, 1997 Hospice Wage Index final rule (62 FR 42860), the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index is used as the raw wage index for the hospice benefit. These raw wage index values are subject to application of the hospice floor to compute the hospice wage index used to determine payments to hospices. As previously discussed, the pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8 would be further adjusted by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8. For example, if County A has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.3994, we would multiply 0.3994 by 1.15, which equals 0.4593. Since 0.4593 is not greater than 0.8, then County A's hospice wage index would be 0.4593. In another example, if County B has a pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index value of 0.7440, we would multiply 0.7440 by 1.15, which equals 0.8556. Because 0.8556 is greater than 0.8, County B's hospice wage index would be 0.8.\\nThe final hospice wage index applicable for FY 2024 (October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024) is available on the CMS website at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice/Hospice-Wage-Index.html.\\nWe received 15 comments on the proposed FY 2024 hospice wage index from various stakeholders, including hospices and national industry associations. A summary of these comments and our responses to those comments are as follows:\\nComment: A few commenters expressed concern with the CBSA designations and wage index values assigned to their geographic areas. Several commenters representing hospices in Coeur d'Alene, ID stated that the economy and cost-of-living of Coeur d'Alene, ID is not reflective of the rest of the Idaho region, but rather is reflective of the “Pacific” region that includes the Spokane, WA CBSA. These commenters recommended that Coeur d'Alene, ID be reassigned to the Spokane, WA CBSA and assigned the wage index value of that CBSA. Another commenter stated that hospices in Montgomery County, MD should be paid the same as hospices in the Washington, DC area because Montgomery County, MD has a similar cost of living as Washington, DC and shares the same labor market when competing for labor. This commenter recommended that the wage index for the Montgomery County/Fredrick, MD CBSA be reassigned to the Washington, DC CBSA or be assigned the highest wage index valuation from among the MSAs metropolitan divisions for the purpose of hospice Medicare payment for a time limited period, such as five years, in order to evaluate the impact on Montgomery County hospices. \\nResponse: We thank the commenters for these recommendations. However, we have used CBSAs for determining hospice payments since FY 2006 and continue to believe that the OMB's geographic area delineations represent a useful proxy for differentiating between labor markets and that the geographic area delineations are appropriate for use in determining Medicare hospice payments. CBSAs provide a uniform and consistent basis for determining statistical area delineations, based on long-standing statistical standards maintained by OMB. Further, OMB conducts periodic review of the standards to ensure their continued usefulness and relevance. Additionally, other provider types, such as Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals, home health agencies (HHAs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), and dialysis facilities, all use CBSAs to define their labor market areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to apply this method consistently among providers. Using the most current OMB delineations provides an accurate representation of geographic variation in wage levels; therefore, we do not believe it would be appropriate to allow hospices in Coeur d'Alene, ID or Montgomery County, MD to be reassigned into a higher CBSA designation. However, if OMB redesignates Coeur d'Alene, ID or Montgomery County, MD into the Spokane, WA or the Washington, DC CBSAs (respectively), we would propose this change in future rulemaking consistent with our longstanding approach of adopting OMB statistical area delineations outlined in the most recent OMB bulletins. \\nComment: A few commenters expressed concern that the wage index values assigned to rural areas negatively impacts rural hospice care. One commenter stated that hospices that serve rural patients receiving services in their homes are subject to a trend of reduced wage index values, creating a continued reduction in their Medicare rates as compared to the national average. Another commenter recommended that CMS assign the wage index value based on a hospice's office location rather than the beneficiary's location. This commenter suggested that it costs more for their hospice to serve rural areas due to the great distance they are required to travel despite being paid at only 80 percent of the wage index. \\nResponse: We thank the commenters for their recommendations. We understand there are variables in providing care that are unique to both urban and rural areas. For instance, rural hospices note higher mileage costs between patients, while urban hospices note additional costs associated with necessary security measures and traffic congestion. However, these factors do not result in lower hospice wage index values in rural areas versus urban areas. The hospice wage index reflects the wages that inpatient hospitals pay in their local geographic areas. Regarding the recommendation to assign the wage index value based on the location of the hospice's office, we continue to believe that is more appropriate to assign the wage index value based on the site of service (the location of the beneficiary) rather than the hospice's office location. Therefore, we apply the wage index value to the labor portion of the hospice payment rate based on the geographic area in which the beneficiary resides when receiving RHC or CHC and the geographic location of the facility for beneficiaries receiving GIP or IRC. \\nComment: Several commenters recommended more far-reaching revisions and reforms to the wage index methodology used under Medicare fee-for-service. These recommendations included: geographic reclassification, implementing an out-migration adjustment for non-hospital providers using the post floor- post reclassified IPPS wage index as the basis for the hospice wage index, and reinstituting the rural floor policy so that no hospice is paid below the rural floor for their state. Another commenter recommended CMS explore policies that seek to reduce the continual wage index disparities between high wage index hospices and low wage index hospices such as has been done in the hospital space. Finally, MedPAC recommended that Congress repeal the existing Medicare wage index statutes, including current exceptions, and require the Secretary to phase in new Medicare wage index systems for hospitals and other types of providers that: use all-employer, occupation-level wage data with different occupation weights for the wage index of each provider type; reflect local area level differences in wages between and within metropolitan statistical areas and statewide rural areas; and smooth wage index differences across adjacent local areas. \\nResponse: We appreciate the commenters' recommendations; however, these comments are outside the scope of the proposed rule. Any changes regarding the adjustment of the hospice payments to account for geographic wage differences, beyond the wage index proposals discussed in the FY 2024 Hospice Wage Index and Rate Update proposed rule, would have to go through notice and comment rulemaking. While CMS and other interested parties, such as MedPAC, have explored potential alternatives to the current CBSA-based labor market system, no consensus has been achieved regarding how best to implement a replacement system. we believe that in the absence of hospice specific wage data, using the pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage data is appropriate and reasonable for hospice payments. Additionally, the regulations that govern hospice payment do not provide a mechanism for allowing hospices to seek geographic reclassification or to utilize the rural floor provisions that exist for IPPS hospitals. The reclassification provision found in section 1886(d)(10) of the Act is specific to hospitals. Section 4410(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) provides that the area wage index applicable to any hospital that is located in an urban area of a state may not be less than the area wage index applicable to hospitals located in rural areas in that state. This rural floor provision is also specific to hospitals. Because the reclassification provision and the hospital rural floor applies only to hospitals, and not to hospices, we continue to believe the use of the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage index results is the most appropriate adjustment to the labor portion of the hospice payment rates. This position is longstanding and consistent with other Medicare payment systems (for example, SNF PPS, IRF PPS, and HH PPS). However, the hospice wage index does include the hospice floor, which is applicable to all CBSAs, both rural and urban. The hospice floor adjusts pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index values below 0.8 by a 15 percent increase subject to a maximum wage index value of 0.8. \\nComment: One commenter recommended lowering the permanent 5-percent cap on wage index decreases to a 3-percent cap to protect hospice providers who are already operating with negative or razor-thin operating margins. \\nResponse: We thank the commenter for their recommendation. However, this is outside the scope of the proposed rule. The policy to apply a permanent 5-percent cap on wage index decreases was finalized in the FY 2023 hospice final rule (87 FR 45677). Any changes to the permanent cap policy would have to be proposed and finalized through the rulemaking process and we have not proposed to make any changes to the cap policy for the upcoming fiscal year. \\nFinal Decision: We are finalizing our proposal to use the FY 2024 pre-floor, pre-reclassified hospital wage index data as the basis for the FY 2024 hospice wage index. The wage index applicable for FY 2024 is available on our website at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice/Hospice-Wage-Index. The hospice wage index for FY 2024 is effective October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.\"}\n",

      "According to the documents, both the proposed and final 2025 Hospice Wage Index rules include the previously implemented policy of a permanent 5-percent cap on wage index decreases. In both rules, it's outlined that the proposed hospice wage index for FY 2025 would be based on the FY 2025 hospital pre-floor, pre-reclassified wage index for hospital cost reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 2020 and before October 1, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology for applying the 5-percent decrease cap on wage index and making comparisons to previous fiscal years' wage index values appears consistent in both the proposed and final rules. There is an indication within the rules that the hospice wage index would not take into account any geographic reclassification of hospitals, with the logic behind this aligning with the regulations that govern hospice payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, both the proposed and finalized rules agree with the idea of using pre-floor, pre-reclassification hospital wage index data for calculating the hospice wage index. They also both propose the methodology where all wage index values lower than 0.8000 are increased by 15 percent up to 0.8000, also known as the \"hospice floor\" adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the documents do not mention any significant differences between the proposed and final 2025 rules, it is noteworthy to indicate that the final rule may include clarifications or adjustments based on public comment, even when fundamental aspects of the rule remain the same. Overall, the rules focus on proposing to use valuable methods to calculate the hospice wage index values continuing in FY 2025, as done in previous years.\n"
