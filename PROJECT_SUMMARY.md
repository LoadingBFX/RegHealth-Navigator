## 2024-06-10 — v0.3

### Summary of Changes
- Implemented section-based processing architecture
- Added caching for processed sections and artifacts
- Updated API endpoints to support section-level operations
- Added document comparison functionality
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added placeholder implementations for LLM integration

### Technical Decisions
- Adopted section-based processing to handle large documents efficiently
- Implemented caching to improve performance and reduce processing time
- Added proper error handling and logging throughout the codebase
- Used placeholder implementations for LLM features to enable frontend development
- Structured API endpoints to support section-level operations

### User–Assistant Discussion Highlights
- User requested section-based processing for better scalability
- Assistant implemented caching and proper error handling
- Both agreed on API structure and placeholder implementations

## 2024-06-09 — v0.2

### Summary of Changes
- Refactored backend and workflow to support section-based processing
- Updated PRD and team instructions to reflect new architecture
- Added/updated modules:
  - `core/xml_partition.py`: Partition XML into logical sections
  - `core/xml_chunker.py`: Chunk each section
  - `core/embedding.py`: Embedding and storage for section chunks
  - `core/llm.py`: Section-level LLM summarization, Q&A, comparison
- Improved API and frontend design for section selection and section-level operations

### Technical Decisions
- All LLM-based features now operate at the section level
- Rationale: Handles very large documents efficiently, avoids LLM context window limitations

### User–Assistant Discussion Highlights
- User clarified need for section-based processing
- Assistant proposed and implemented partition–chunk–embed–section-level LLM workflow
- Both agreed on API and frontend supporting section selection

## 2024-06-07 — v0.1

### Summary of Changes
- Initial project scaffold: frontend (React), backend (FastAPI), scripts
- Basic XML chunking and whole-document embedding/LLM workflow
- Initial PRD and team instructions

### Technical Decisions
- Started with whole-document chunking and LLM operations
- No section-based processing; scalability not yet addressed

### User–Assistant Discussion Highlights
- User requested fullstack scaffold and best practices
- Assistant provided initial codebase and documentation
