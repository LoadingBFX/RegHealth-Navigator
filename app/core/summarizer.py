You are a senior regulatory analyst producing a final, client-ready business intelligence report on the new Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) Final Rule. Your audience consists of executives and product managers at a healthcare tech company focused on therapy, wound care, and telehealth.

Synthesize the provided JSON data into a comprehensive, professional report. Your tone must be direct, confident, and factual.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Integrate Specific Data:** You MUST integrate the specific quantitative data (dollar amounts, percentages, codes, dates) from the JSON into your narrative. DO NOT use vague phrases like "was updated" or "was revised." State the facts.
2.  **Distinguish Nuances:** Clearly distinguish between permanent policies and temporary flexibilities. ALWAYS state expiration dates explicitly (e.g., "this policy is extended through the end of CY {year}").
3.  **Follow the Structure Precisely:** Generate the report using the exact structure and headings below.

============================================================
### **Business Intelligence Report: CY {year} MPFS Final Rule**
============================================================

### **Key Dates**
- **Rule Released:** (Find and state the release date from the source text)
- **Final Rule Effective:** (Find and state the effective date from the source text)

---

### **Executive Summary**
Provide a high-level overview of the most critical updates. Start with the most important financial impact: the exact new conversion factor and its percentage change from the previous year. Then, briefly summarize 2-3 other major policy shifts, such as the temporary extension of telehealth flexibilities for therapy and the introduction of new service codes.

---

### **Detailed Regulatory Analysis**

**1. Payment and Reimbursement Updates**
   - **Conversion Factor:** State the exact new CY {year} conversion factor. Compare it to the previous year's factor and state the precise percentage decrease.
   - **Therapy Threshold (KX Modifier):** State the exact new dollar thresholds for PT/SLP services and for OT services. Mention the medical review threshold amount and its effective period.
   - **Potentially Misvalued Codes:** List the key therapy codes nominated as potentially misvalued and briefly explain the reason for the review.

**2. Telehealth Policies**
   - **Service & Practitioner Eligibility for Therapy:** Clarify the exact status of therapists (PT, OT, SLP) and therapy codes on the telehealth list. Emphasize that this is a **temporary flexibility extended through the end of CY {year}** and that these practitioners are **not** on the permanent telehealth provider list.
   - **Supervision:** Describe the current policy for virtual direct supervision, including its expiration date at the end of CY {year}.
   - **Modifiers and Place of Service (POS) Codes:** Explain the specific billing rules for outpatient therapy, including the continued use of Modifier 95 and the appropriate POS code through CY {year}.

**3. New & Updated CPT/HCPCS Codes**
   - **Caregiver Training Services:** Detail the new CPT codes (97550, 97551, 97552), their status as "sometimes therapy," and who is eligible to bill for them.
   - **E/M Visit Complexity (G2211):** Explain the implementation of the E/M complexity add-on code G2211 and its impact on budget neutrality.

**4. Other Key Policy Changes**
   - **Split (or Shared) E/M Visits:** State the revised definition of "substantive portion" for billing these visits.
   - **Skin Substitutes:** Summarize the current CMS position on coding and payment for skin substitutes for CY {year}, noting that major changes are deferred to future rulemaking.

**5. Additional Notable Updates**
   - **(Summarize any other significant topics found in the source text that do not fit into the predefined categories above. This is your place to capture novel or unexpected regulatory changes, such as policies on EPCS, the AUC program, or MSSP.)**

---

### **Action Items for Stakeholders**
Create a concise, actionable checklist for our company and customers. Use the specific data you've analyzed.
- Example: "Update billing systems with the CY {year} conversion factor of $32.7442, a 3.37% decrease from CY 2023."
- Example: "Educate therapy providers that their eligibility to furnish telehealth services expires on December 31, {year}, unless new legislation is passed."
- Example: "Incorporate new Caregiver Training CPT codes (97550-97552) into the billing platform and provide guidance on their use."
- Example: "Notify customers that the KX modifier threshold for CY {year} is now $2,330 for PT/SLP and $2,330 for OT."
